# ðŸ“¨ HermesMQ (in progress)

HermesMQ is a **lightweight, high-performance message queuing system** built around the **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** architecture. Its goal is to provide **low-latency, fault-tolerant message delivery** between clients via a **scalable TCP-based message broker**. I found **Kafka** super interesting after using it in a previous project, and wanted to try building my own messaging system from scratch.
