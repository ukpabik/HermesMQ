# ðŸ“¨ HermesMQ

HermesMQ is a **lightweight, high-performance message queuing system** built around the **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** architecture. 

I found **Kafka** super interesting after using it in a previous project, and wanted to try building my own messaging system from scratch.

Run a broker:
```
go run cmd/broker
```

> [!NOTE]
> I will be making a dashboard and a way to test the client/server interactions soon!
